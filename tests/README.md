# Tests of the `perftest` package

The `perftest` package uses only the `doctest` framework for unit testing. As testing here is fairly straightforward, we do not need any complex unit testing tools, such as mocking or randomized testing. (In fact, you can use both in `doctest`, though the readability could slightly suffer from that.)

> The use of `doctest`ing as the only testing framework in `perftest` is an experiment. Tests in `perftest` are abundant, and are collected in four locations: [the main README](../README.md), docstrings in [the main perftest module](../perftest/perftest.py), [the docs folder](../docs/), and [this folder](./).

`doctest`ing joins two functions: testing and documentation. This can be seen in [README](../README.md), in which `doctest`s mainly help to keep the examples up-to-date. The documentation files in [the docs folder](../docs/) are more wordy, as the documentation function has a higher priority in them. Here, however, testing is more important, so these files are not that wordy, and their main purpose is testing.

Initially, [the docs folder](../docs/) contained Markdown files while [the tests folder](./) contained text files (as text files are also a good way of writing doctests). However, it quickly occurred that Markdown files are a little more readable, especially in a browser, so all testing files are now formatted using Markdown. The testing files here, however, has much less explanation, limited mainly to explanation helping the reader understand the tests or some of their aspects.

> Note that `perftest` is now covered by many testes, so it takes some time to run them. Therefore, some examples use low values of `number` and `repeat`, so that the tests do not take an hour or so. In real performance testing, you should use relevant values of these arguments.


## Operating system

The package is checked under both Windows and Linux. Python in Linux uses less memory and is quicker than in Windows. The tests of `perftest`, then, are usually at the other side of conservativity, so that they all pass in both systems: The point of testing of `perftest` is to check if the package works fine, not to check actual performance of the functions used in examples. In actual performance testing, however, you should choose suitable limits â€” but  do remember about the difference in operating systems.
